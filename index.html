                    <h5>President and CEO of GLAAD</h5>
                    <p>LGBTQ representation in media is critical for the path towards social acceptance. Although strides toward equality have been substantial in the past few years, there are many more milestones to meet before the LGBTQ community can reach the ultimate goal of acceptance. In this talk, Sarah Kate Ellis will make the case for why LGBTQ media presence is critical and how we can work together to realize full acceptance for the LGBTQ community.</p>
