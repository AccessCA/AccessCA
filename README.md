## What is Access California?
Access California helps you find out if you're eligible for public programs with one simple form. Currently we help determine if you're eligible for CalFresh, MediCal, and CalWORKS.

## Who is Access California for?
Access California is for anyone who lives in California! More than 1/3 of people who are eligible for CalFresh don't know that they qualify. So even if you don't think you'll be eligible for public programs, it never hurts to check.

## Why Access California?
Public programs like CalFresh can be really hard to navigate - like really hard. Different sources provide different information about eligibility requirements. Applications are long and confusing. Websites are clunky and not mobile friendly. We want to help change that.
